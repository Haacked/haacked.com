  Thanks.



  I feel you on Postel's Law. I've been looking at a lot of strongly typed C# code and even tho it's verbose and redundant at times, the benefits of a strongly typed language seem huge. A function being able to lockdown what it accepts as input seems like the most basic need in a programming language, otherwise you have to validate the data in every function, or just trust it's programmed right. But maybe the success and widespread adoption of JavaScript, a loosely typed language, is one argument for being liberal in what you accept.



  All the best
