More and more people are using GitHub in interesting ways for non-software projects. For example, a co-worker of mine has a repository where he is tracking a pet project:

> I bought a crappy 1987 Honda XR600 and I am going to turn it into something awesome

He’s not the first to do it, nor will he be the last. A while back, Wired ran an article about a man who renovated his home on GitHub.

Another person open sourced his genome. Sadly, genetic technology is not quite at the point where he can accept pull requests all the way to the source.

Just the other day, I read a blog post about a company that uses GitHub for everything.

Meanwhile, I used GitHub to save my marriage. Ok, I might be engaging in a tiny bit of hyperbole for dramatic effect (right honey? Right?!!!).

Let me back up a moment to provide some context.

One of the central points of David Allen’s Getting Things Done productivity system is that all the lists of stuff we constantly keep in our head uses up “psychic RAM” and that creates stress. This “psychic weight” drags us down and wears on our psyche.

And when you’re a family with a house and kids, you need a lot of RAM. There’s constantly things breaking down in the house, events and appointments to drag the kids to, recurring chores that need to be attended to, and so on. If you’re not on top of these things, they fall through the cracks.

There’s two common approaches to handling this.

The first is to constantly think about everything that needs to be done and bearing the full psychic weight and stress of always being on point.

The second is what I call the squeaky wheel approach. You remain blissfully remain ignorant and unaware of all these demands until a point when something is so bad it absolutely demands your attention or until a person who tends to do the first approach makes it a priority for you. A lot of things tend to get dropped with this approach that shouldn’t be dropped.

The second approach carries with it much less psychic weight, but it isn’t very respectful to a person doing the first approach and leads to a lot of interpersonal tension.

I’ll let you guess which approach I was.

Unfortunately for me, part of the reason I employ the squeaky wheel approach is that I have a terrible memory and I’m very good at not noticing things that need to get done. So for the most part, things were getting done and I just didn’t even know.

So my wife and I had a discussion about this and I realized, I can’t make myself have a better memory and suddenly improve my ability to notice things need to get done. So I proposed an idea. Let’s try something that works very well for me at work – GitHub issues.

The hope is that rather than have both of us maintain all these lists in our head, when we noticed something needs to be done, we create a GitHub issue and then trust that it will get done and we don’t have to think about it any more. At that point, we rely on the system than our own memories, which relieves a lot of the mental stress.

I created a private repository for our household. Here’s an example of a recent issue. Notice that I take advantage of the wonderful Task Lists feature of GitHub Flavored Markdown. That feature has been a godsend.

In the example below, I broke down the task of cleaning out the dead bugs from the light fixtures into a list of tasks. I decided to take on this one and assigned it to myself (not shown in the screenshot as I forgot initially).

Unfortunately, the work involved in closing an issue sometimes leads to the need to create new issues. In this case, I learned a valuable lesson. Don’t use a screw driver when putting a light cover back on. The explosion of glass this created fortunately didn’t get anyone hurt.
