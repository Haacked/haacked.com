Well this is a bit embarrassing.

I recently [migrated my blog to Jekyll](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/12/02/dr-jekyll-and-mr-haack/) and subsequently wrote about my painstaking work to [preserve my URLs](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/12/03/jekyll-url-extensions/).

But after the migration, I faced an onslaught of reports of broken URLs. So what happened?

Well it's silly. The [program I wrote to migrate my posts to Jekyll](https://github.com/Haacked/subtext-jekyll-exporter) had a subtle flaw. In order to verify that my URL would be correct, it made a web request using the generated file name to see if the resulting URL would be correct.
