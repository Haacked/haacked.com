If I had to pick only one trait I hope to instill in my children, it's empathy. It's on my mind because of [this beautiful post by Reg Braythwayt](http://braythwayt.com/2014/03/17/empathy.html).

> Empathy is not seeing the world with your eyes from where someone else is standing, it’s seeing the world with their eyes, from their perspective, coloured with their hopes and fears, their life experience.

> Empathy is putting yourself in someone else’s shoes and then overcoming your own thoughts of what you would do in their shoes and imagining what it feels like to be them in their shoes.

You'll note the unnecessary "u" in "coloured". Reg is Canadian, but don't let that stop you from reading the whole post. It's brief but wonderful.

In fact, it's so good, part of the point of my blog post is to draw attention to his post. Especially the iconic image in his post that is a powerful illustration of real empathy.

But this reminds me of a Malcom in the Middle episode entitled _Reese Cooks_. Reese is an older brother to Malcom who exhibits mild psychopathic tendencies. In an effort to show him more attention, ~~Heisenberg~~Hal, his dad, signs him up for a cooking class.

Reese discovers he has natural talent at cooking and really takes to the class. The parents are amazed at his transformation until a cooking contest where he ends up sabotaging the other contestants dishes because "It was fun!"

His mom, Lois, and dad then attempt to teach him about empathy.

<dialog>
<dt>Lois:</dt><dd>How would you feel if you were that poor woman whose quiche you salted?</dd>
<dt>Reese:</dt><dd>…Fat?</dd>
<dt>Hal:</dt><dd>Reese, do you know what empathy is?</dd> 
<dt>Reese:</dt><dd>No.</dd>
<dt>Hal:</dt><dd>Well, empathy is putting yourself in other people's shoes so you can feel what they do. If you hurt someone, empathy makes you hurt as well.</dd>
<dt>Reese:</dt><dd>Then why would you want empathy?</dd>
</dialog>

Why would you want it indeed? It sounds kind of, well, painful. Why would anyone want to be empathetic? How do you explain the benefit to someone who's not inclined to be empathetic? How do you explain to someone who seems to only look out for his or herself?

__My answer? It's in your own best interest to be empathetic.__

I don't mean this in some vague karmic fashion. I mean concretely.

### It makes for better relationships with others.

Imagine if you constantly misunderstood the intentions and motivations of those around you? That leads to so much unnecessary conflict. Empathy helps you better understand the mindset of those around you and address perhaps what's really bothering them rather than talking past them or working towards cross purposes.

### It helps you make better choices for your own well being.

Often, the lens we view others with hides what's really going on. This can have detrimental effects to our decision making process. In effect, our own biases are feeding ourselves misinformation. Empathy helps one see the truth of a situation and act accordingly.

Too often, people spend much of their time engaging in behavior that is ultimately not in their long term self interest for an apparent short term gain. Sometimes it's obvious. It might feel real good to smoke that cigarette, but in the long term you know you'd be better off quitting.

But sometimes, it's more subtle. For example, when a marginalized person speaks out against some abuse they've faced, you might feel as it's an attack on people like you so you go rage on the Twitters even though you don't know the person and have no skin in this particular game. Lack of empathy often leads people to ascribe the worst motives and demonize others who don't share the same worldview.

Empathy makes you realize that everybody has their struggles in life and are just trying to get by. People spend their time concerned about their own well-being, not on negatively affecting yours. As a friend once told me, we're all just squirrels trying to get a nut in this world. 

And spending your time raging against others is not only harmful to them, it's a collossal waste of your time. There are over 6 billion people on the planet that you don't know, many of them speaking out about abuses. You don't have the time to contribute to all their abuse.

What kind of sad life is it to demonize people who don't view the world through your perspective. To see these folks as interested in harming your way of life as opposed to what's more likely the truth, they're just trying to get by in life just like you are. As a friend once told me, we're all just squirrels trying to get a nut. 

### It makes you a more effective person

All too often I see leaders who flip a bozo bit on an employee. Or color their experiences through their own lens. This makes the leader extremely ineffective at motivating people to do their best work. It creates an environment where those who don't see things the same way as the leader are demoralized, even though they may be doing great work otherwise.

Likewise, I often see employees flip the bozo bit on a leader because of lack of empathy. This makes the employee ineffective. It's hard to influence decisions when you lack basic empathy to the view point you're arguing against.

## Conclusion

Someone truly concerned about their own well being in the long run would see the benefits of empathy.

This isn't the first time I've written about empathy and won't be the last. You might find my other posts that talk about empathy in various contexts helpful.

* [Building an Open Source Community requires empathy](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/03/26/building-a-strong-open-source-community-requires-empathy.aspx/) where I talk about having empathy for your users as well as a thick skin.
* [You don't need a thick skin](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/12/17/you-do-not-need-a-thick-skin.aspx/) where I contradict myself and suggest maybe you don't need a thick skin.
* [Reflective Parenting](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/05/27/reflective-parenting.aspx/) where I talk about empathy's role in parenting.

Now it's easy to talk about empathy to those who want to be more empathetic. But if we get down to it, why? Why would I want my children to be empathetic? What's the benefit?
