A while back, I wrote [The Case Against Pay for Performance](https://haacked.com/archive/2014/08/14/pay-for-performance/). Checkmate. Case closed. Or so I thought. Like many bloggers, I suffer from delusions of grandeur that millions of people ponder every word I write, are enlightened by insight, and then compelled to action.

Alas, it's not to be. Instead, I find that the belief in the power of rewards to spur higher performance persists despite all the evidence to the contrary.

I believe one reason people persist in believing that paying for performance works is rooted in [Theory X thinking](https://haacked.com/archive/2017/10/07/managers-gone-bad/).

> [it] reflects an underlying belief that management must counteract an inherent human tendency to avoid work”

Another reason people continue to believe in them is they seem to work, temporarily. As Alfie Kohn notes in [Why Incentive Plans Cannot Work](https://hbr.org/1993/09/why-incentive-plans-cannot-work)...

> Rewards buy temporary compliance, so it looks like the problems are solved. It’s harder to spot the harm they cause over the long term.

Many folks counter that they don't work because they're often implemented improperly. I contend that they _cannot_ work. Alfie Kohn backs me up (emphasis mine)...

> According to numerous studies in laboratories, workplaces, classrooms, and other settings, rewards typically undermine the very processes they are intended to enhance.
> The findings suggest that the failure of any given incentive program is __due less to a glitch in that program than to the inadequacy of the psychological assumptions that ground all such plans.__

### Why it doesn't work

First, we need to differentiate "works" with "has an effect." Certainly rewards have an effect.

As the Kohn article notes,

> Do rewards work? The answer depends on what we mean by “work.” Research suggests that, by and large, rewards succeed at securing one thing only: temporary compliance. When it comes to producing lasting change in attitudes and behavior, however, rewards, like punishment, are strikingly ineffective.

Not only that, rewards often have an outcome that seems positive but is overall a negative. An analogy from the world of sports might make this point clear.

[Lionel Messi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi) is the best soccer player in the world today, if not all time (I know I'm inviting argument here, feel free to write your rebuttal on your own blog, but for now, bear with me). He is the leading scorer in La Liga (the top Spanish soccer league where he plays for FC Barcelona) with 16 goals this season so far. The player in second place is far behind with 11.

Suppose his team offers him $100 Million for every goal he scores. That would certainly have an effect. He would score more goals. So it works! Right?

Not so fast. In order for Lionel to score more goals, he'd need to take more chances. And this means taking more ill advised shots when he should have passed to a teammate. In order to score more goals, he'd have less assists. And Messi is currently in second place in La Liga in assists. That's how good he is. In this example, rewarding him for goals would have a negative overall effect on his team's outcomes.

This is a classic case of an unexpected externality (aka be careful what you wish for).

Perhaps we can fix the rewards program. Imagine if his team changes the incentive to $100 Million per game his team wins. Would his team's performance increase? Likely not! After all, he and his team are _already_ doing everything in their power to win every game. Offering more pay won't somehow magically make the team better. At best, that kind of money might incentivize them to cheat by bribing refs.

Freakonomics seems to bear this out in [a study on another professional sport](http://freakonomics.com/2012/01/01/football-freakonomics-incentives/), American Football...

> That’s what Brian Burke of Advanced NFL Stats did for us, analyzing all multi-million-dollar contracts for NFL running backs since the 2000 season, a sample of 28 contracts. He found that in the year after signing their big deals, these running backs averaged .3 yards less per carry. That’s a pretty startling drop.

Chances are, these players were already playing as well as possible. There's no way to eke out more performance by simply giving them money.

The Kohn article lists other unexpected outcomes of rewards (really, just read the whole thing)...

> 1. “Pay is not a motivator.”
> 2. Rewards punish.
> 3. Rewards rupture relationships.
> 4. Rewards ignore reasons.
> 5. Rewards discourage risk-taking.
> 6. Rewards undermine interest.

### Bringing it back to the tech industry

Ok, this won't be a surprise, but most programmers are not elite athletes. What's this got to do with us?

In practice, we're not all that different. We have a unique skill that is very valuable. We try and make the most of our skill day in and day out at work. When solving a problem, we think our hardest. It's really hard to half-ass problem solving. For the most part, we're motivated by intrinsic incentives such as [purpose, mastery, and autonomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc).

Waving more money in front of me won't help me solve a problem or code up a solution any better. It won't increase my output.

At best, like in the first Messi example, you might be able to coerce more hours out of a person. But that's not a sustainable approach. The research is clear that [long hours backfire for people and companies](https://hbr.org/2015/08/the-research-is-clear-long-hours-backfire-for-people-and-for-companies). This is such a Theory X manager move.

Instead, when you consider employees as intrinsically motivated to do their best work, you realize the way to improve their performance is through feedback and providing opportunities to learn and grow. In other words, help them work smarter, not harder.

### Paying The Best

I anticipate some will point out that Messi is one of the highest paid players in La Liga. So isn't that a form of incentive pay? Doesn't it show that incentive pay does work?

__Consider this, the incentives Messi earns today are effectively available to all other players in the league. If they could consistently perform at the level he does, they'd receive a lot more pay. So why don't they do so? Are they not as motivated as much as he is?__

His team, Barcelona, is not paying him for performance. They're paying him for his _value_. This is an important distinction. Because he performs as well as he does, he brings in a lot of value to Barcelona.

Not only that, many other teams are willing to pay a lot of money to have him join their team instead. So Barcelona has to pay him something close to his market value. This high pay isn't to incentivize him to perform well, but to incentivize him to stay at Barcelona.

And yet, despite all that, he _still_ could make significantly more at another team. This makes it clear that pay isn't the only motivation for him to continue to play at Barcelona.
