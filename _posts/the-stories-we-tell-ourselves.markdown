Everyone is the protagonist of their own narrative. And in this narrative, we tend to see ourselves as the "good guy" or "good girl" of the story.

As a recurring thought experiment, it's valuable to turn this narrative on its head and imagine that you're the villain of your own narrative instead. What lessons would that provide?

Today, while driving my family to work and school, a driver from the right lane slowly drifted across two lanes to get into the left lane cutting me off. I had to brake sharply not to hit him. I pulled aside him and glared over, but he did not look back.

Naturally, the running narrative in my head incorporated this into the story. This young punk was oblivious to what's going around him. He's a bad driver and a bad person.

But I had this sudden epiphany. What if I were the villain in this story? It did seem this guy had just pulled into the right lane from another street and he needed to get to the left lane in order to turn on the freeway. Was I perhaps going a bit over the speed limit? (The answer to that is usually yes.)

In this new narrative, I was the overbearing driver speeding along not allowing this person to innocently make it over to the turn lane. It made me realize that I've been in his shoes and have glared at the driver who was coming in too fast as I was trying to change lanes. I clearly couldn't have been in the right in every situation.

In a way, this thought experiment is very similar to ideas I wrote in my post [Argue Well By Losing](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/10/21/argue-well-by-losing.aspx/). I think the difference is the techniques I wrote about in that post apply when you're in the midst of a debate.

But changing your narrative is a technique for challenging long held beliefs, biases, and prejudices. When you think about someone who deeply holds a belief that's antithetical to your own, realize that in their mind, they are the 'good person" of their narrative and you, in an attempt to refute their belief, are "the bad guy." That can lead to understanding. Perhaps you still want to change their mind, but the tactics you take might change. Rather than simply attacking, you might look for ways to help them see that the opposition to their beliefs are not the "bad guys." A great example of this approach is in this post [The Distress of the Privilege](http://weeklysift.com/2012/09/10/the-distress-of-the-privileged/).

> Privileged distress. I’m not bringing this up just to discuss old movies. As the culture evolves, people who benefitted from the old ways invariably see themselves as victims of change. The world used to fit them like a glove, but it no longer does. Increasingly, they find themselves in unfamiliar situations that feel unfair or even unsafe. Their concerns used to take center stage, but now they must compete with the formerly invisible concerns of others.

> If you are one of the newly-visible others, this all sounds whiny compared to the problems you face every day. It’s tempting to blast through such privileged resistance with anger and insult.

> Tempting, but also, I think, a mistake. The privileged are still privileged enough to foment a counter-revolution, if their frustrated sense of entitlement hardens.

Note that this doesn't mean you excuse the marginalization of others by the privileged. It means you gain an understand of what's going on in their heads. How they rationalize it with the narrative that they are a good person.

Unfortunately, this doesn't make for good politics where politicians are pressured to form extreme views with no wiggle room in order to appeal to the disproportionately loud extremists in their parties. But the rest of us don't have to wallow in that bullshit. We can realize we're all the good guys of our own narratives just trying to live decent lives, even if we disagree on how to do that.
