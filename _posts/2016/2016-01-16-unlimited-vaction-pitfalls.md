When I joined GitHub [four years ago](https://github.com/blog/1002-phil-haack-is-a-githubber), their benefit of an unlimited paid time off seemed lavish and ahead of its time. I wasn't planning to take a six month trip to trek across Nepal (or more realistically sit at home in my pajamas playing X-Box for months at a time), but I liked the message it sent.

It told me this company valued its employees, wanted them to not burn out, and trusted them to behave like stakeholders in the company and be responsible about their vacation.

This, in tandem with the flexible work hours, helps me arrange my work schedule so that I can be a better spouse and parent. I walk my son to to the bus stop in the mornings. I chaperone every field trip I can. I take the day off when my kids have no school.

I also believe it's a tool to help recruit great people.

For example, in their famous [Culture Deck](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664), Netfilx notes [that...](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/41-Responsible_PeopleThrive_on_Freedomand_are)

> Responsible People Thrive on Freedom and are Worthy of Freedom

They go [on...](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/42-Our_model_is_to_increaseemployee)

> Our model is to _increase_ employee freedom as we grow, rather than limit it, to continue to attract and nourish innovative people, so we have a better chance of sustained success

In one slide they note that "Process-focus Drives More Talent Out"

The most talented people have the least tolerance for processes that serve to curtail their freedom to do their best work. They'd rather be judged by the impact of their work than when and how much they worked.

This is why Netflix also has a policy that there is no vacation policy. They do not track vacation in the same way they do not track hours worked per day or week.

As you might expect, there are some subtle pitfalls to such a policy or lack thereof. I believe such policies that rely on the good judgment of individuals are well intentioned, but often ignore the very real sociological factors that surround such policies.

Only the pathologically naive would believe the policy truly allows for unlimited vacation. For example, GitHub also has a very generous parental leave policy that consists of four months of paid time off for either parent when a new child enters the family through birth or adoption. I love that we have this policy, but why would it be needed if we have unlimited paid time off already?

Because, as with most things where there's no explicit policy in place, there's an implicit policy. But it's an implicit policy where nobody really knows the rules because the rules are driven by subtle social cues from managers and co-workers. And the rules might even be different from team to team even in a small company because of different unsaid expectations.

Travis CI (the company) [realized this issue in 2014](http://www.paperplanes.de/2014/12/10/from-open-to-minimum-vacation-policy.html).

> When everyone keeps track of their own vacation days, two things can happen. They either forget about them completely, or they're uncertain about how much is really okay to use as vacation days.

They also noted that people at companies with unlimited time off tend to take _less_ time off or work here and there during their vacations.

A short-sighted management team might look at this as a plus, but it's a recipe for burnout among their most committed employees. Humans need to take a break from time to time to recharge.

Travis CI took the unusual step of instituting a minimum vacation policy. I commend them for taking this step. In talking about this with a my friend Drew Miller, he had an astute observation.

He noted that while such a policy is helpful, it doesn't necessarily address the root problem. If people aren't taking vacation in a company with no vacation policy, one should take a deep look at the culture at the company that made it so that people felt like they couldn't take time off.

For example, and the Travis-CI post notes this, leaders at a company have to model good behavior. If the founders, executives, managers, take very little vacation, they unconsciously communicate to others that taking vacation is not valued or important at this company.

His words struck me. While I like the idea of a minimum vacation to help people feel more comfortable taking vacation, I feel such a move has to be in tandem with a concerted effort to practice what we preach.

Ever since then, as a manager, I've tried to model good responsible vacation behavior. I do the usual things you expect such as make sure to hand off what needs handing off before hand and letting everyone know. But more importantly, I disconnect and stay away from work completely. I do this even though I sometimes _want_ to check work emails for fun because I want the people on my team to feel free to do the same when they are on vacation.
