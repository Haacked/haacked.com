A few of my teams are hiring so I thought I'd take that as an opportunity to write about what's been keeping me so busy at GitHub lately and draw attention to the job postings. If you don't give a rat's ass about me, feel free to skip to the job postings at the bottom. By the way, even if you do give a rat's ass, please keep it to yourself. What I've been up to does not include collecting rodent derri√®res.

I still don't know why that's a phrase we use, but I'm sure Mark Twain is involved...that rapscallion.

Several months ago, I took a new position as an Engineering Director at GitHub. The position was new in the sense it was both new to GitHub and new to me. What this means is that I now manage managers. I guess this is what happens to people who like to [blog about blogging](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/03/13/Blogging-About-Blogging-AboutBlogging.aspx/), they end up managing managers.

At GitHub, engineering managers are very hands on technically. They are technical leaders who help coach teams to greater success. Kind of like Pete Rose who was a player-manager when he broke the all-time hit record set by the irascible Ty Cobb.

Directors, on the other hand are much more focused on people and management issues. We're much less hands on technically, though I try to keep my hands dirty with code here and there. Instead, we try and focus on what will equip the managers and their teams to be more successful. How can I help my managers be better? What systems can I put in place so the people they manage work well together and grow in their careers and as teams. Sometimes I make mistakes, but I try hard to learn from them and then incorporate that learning into the systems and culture at work so they're less likely to happen again.

When I do spend time on technical work, it is focused on strategic and big picture issues. Every engineer should be thinking this way, but I have the "benefit" of not having a primary responsibility to write production code which means I can dedicate more time to this sort of work.

The four teams that I work with are Atom, Electron, Desktop, and Editor Tools (the team responsible for the [GitHub extension for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.github.com/)). I am incredibly lucky to get to work with such a talented group of people. I've had to learn so much in a short time to even understand the conversations they're having, much less participate.

So that leads me to the topic at hand. Several of these teams are hiring. We're looking for engineers who are great team players to work with us on some great products. Check out these job postings and if you think this job is for you, hit the big blue Apply button.

So why GitHub?

For me, [it's the story of Anna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzuBJTtwm3o). We're building the tools and communities that make stories like this a reality all over the world. In a [recent Octotale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LreQfx5x740), Desert Horse-Grant, the Director of Strategic Planning and Operations at Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center noted that "cancer will be solved on a computer."

We're not solving cancer, but we build the tools for those who are. And that's what gets me inspired every day.
