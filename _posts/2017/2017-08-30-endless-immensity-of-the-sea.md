One of my favorite quotes about leadership is attributed to the French author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. One variation goes like this:

> If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people together to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.

It doesn't bother me that he probably never wrote this. It's most likely a [reformulation of a theme he wrote about](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/08/25/sea/). But that doesn't diminish the truth in the quote.

![Obligatory image of the sea](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19977/29899178-c2771a0a-8d9e-11e7-9168-52682a4b3e93.png)

When I joined GitHub almost six years ago, we were the closest thing I've seen to the embodiment of this idea. The endless sea for us was the software community. We longed to make super-fans. To build a software tool and community that delighted our users. We still do. We didn't have managers to tell us what to do. We didn't think we needed them. And at fifty employees, we probably didn't.

But as we grew, we ran into many challenges. We reached the point where we decided we needed managers. It's a story that many growing companies have gone through. In truth, what we really needed wasn't necessary managers, but management and leadership. It's like deciding that society needs cars when what people really need is transportation. Cars are certainly an expedient solution to the problem, but they aren't the only ones. And they introduce their own set of problems.

This is not to say that small companies should avoid adding managers. Managers can be a solution. But add them with care. And do not conflate managers with management and leadership. A company that adds managers hasn't necessarily solved its management problems. Done poorly, it's exacerbated them. Too often management is introduced as if throwing a wrench at a broken machine and hope by chance it gets fixed. It requires careful attention and focus on the problems managers are meant to solve.

Another trap is to conflate leadership and structure with hierarchy. That's at the heart of this quote. The [Valve handbook](http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf) covers this well.

> Hierarchy is great for maintaining predictability and repeatability. It simplifies planning and makes it easier to
control a large group of people from the top down, which is why military organizations rely on it so heavily.
> But when you’re an entertainment company that’s spent the last decade going out of its way to recruit the most
intelligent, innovative, talented people on Earth, telling them to sit at a desk and do what they’re told obliterates
99 percent of their value. We want innovators, and that means maintaining an environment where they’ll flourish.

The quote refers to "entertainment company" but I think it equally applies to any company where you have work that's primarily intellectual in nature. And the part about how hierarchy serves the military is itself [challenged by leaders such as David Marquet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLRH5J_93LQ), a former nuclear submarine commander, who notes that when he stopped giving orders his crew performed better.

I've heard that perhaps Valve doesn't live up to the ideals put forth in their handbook. If so, that's a shame. Regardless, there's a lot of gold in the handbook.

It's unfortunate, but I believe it's rare to see this kind of leadership. Successful managers are often lionized and then grow to believe the hype. Too much credit is given to the singular leaders and not the team that made it possible. We focus too much on individual performance despite all the evidence that [high functioning _teams_ matter more](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?mcubz=0).

Even worse, managers stop trusting their people. They feel they need to be motivated with the stick rather than with purpose. They form a private group of managers where they privately commiserate and diminish the concerns of their people treating them like spoiled children rather than adults in a show of profound lack of empathy. Not all managers, mind you. But enough of these in a company creates an unnecessarily adversarial culture between managers and others.

It doesn't need to be this way. More is expected of leaders. Lead by example rather than fiat and others will follow it. Those that consistently don't can be show the door in a kind respectful manner.

I long for the endless immensity of the sea. It's why I love to ship software. I don't need someone to tell me what to do, but I often benefit when someone shows me a vision of what's possible and where we'd like to go.
