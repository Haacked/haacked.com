[Twin Falls](http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/twin-falls-state-park) lies around a forty minute drive east of Bellevue, Washington. From the [trail head](https://goo.gl/maps/Z3wQEg62xzB2), the trail leads to views of three separate waterfalls, contrary to the name. I suppose "Twin Falls" has a nicer ring to it than "Triplet falls."

Focus too much on the hike to the falls and you miss the side trails down to the Snoqualmie River. The river is refreshing (aka cold) and full of boulders. At one point along the river, you can hop from boulder to boulder to reach an island that splits the river.

On a recent trip, I took my kids and their friends to this island. There's a trio of large boulders in the middle of the river off the tip of the island. To reach them, you have to wade into  the water and fight a strong current. I ventured into the water to climb one such boulder with a flat, but angled, top. The vantage point gave me a fine view of the river valley and the kids skipping stones down below.

As I sat there, I contemplated a random thought. Scenes like this are often used to set up a blog post (or "Medium piece" if you're fancy). An author takes a story from their life, or a historical anecdote, and uses it to start a post. The story seems unrelated at first. What's the point?

This is before the author gets to work with some rhetorical wizardry. By the end of the piece, the author reveals an important life lesson in the original story. And like a fine rug, it ties it all together to the point of the whole post.

It's a pattern so common I've labeled it the calling card of the Medium post.

The thought struck me, would this moment serve such a purpose? Would a major life lesson reveal itself to me right now? Something I could leverage as social media fodder for the consumption of others. I pondered. And pondered. Nope. Nothing.

No life hack or societal lesson or philosophical truth revealed itself to me. Nothing I could sell for increased follower counts or likes or ad revenue invaded my thoughts.

No, I would have to come to grips that I had nothing to learn from this moment. Nothing to share. There, with the sun shining overhead, the river flowing around me, a breeze on my face, I would have to enjoy it for what it is. A moment. My moment. And just be.

At least until I reached my computer.
