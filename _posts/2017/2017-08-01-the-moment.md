[Twin Falls](http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/twin-falls-state-park) lies around a forty minute drive east of Bellevue, Washington. From the [trailhead](https://goo.gl/maps/Z3wQEg62xzB2), the trail leads to views of three separate waterfalls, contrary to the name. I suppose "Twin Falls" has a nicer ring to it than "Triplet falls."

Focus too much on the hike to the falls and you miss the side trails down to the Snoqualmie River. The river is refreshing (aka cold) and full of boulders. At one point along the river, you can hop from boulder to boulder to reach an island that splits the river. On a recent trip, I took my kids and their friends to this island. I ventured into the current to climb a large boulder with a slanted flat top where I sat with a fine view of the river valley and the kids skipping stones.

For some reason, the thought popped in my head how scenes like this are often used to set up a blog post or "Medium piece" if you're fancy. The author starts with a personal story or a historical anecdote that seems unrelated or even banal. At first. But through rhetorical wizardry and a lot of superfluous words (such as superfluous), the author reveals an important life lesson in the original anecdote that ties in neatly to the point of the whole post.

It's a pattern so common I've labeled it the calling card of the Medium post.

I wondered, would this moment serve such a purpose? Would a major life lesson reveal itself to me so that I could leverage it as social media fodder for the consumption of others. I pondered. And pondered. Nope. Nothing.

No life hack or societal lesson or philosophical truth revealed itself to me. No, I would not sell this moment for increased follower counts or likes or faves. This moment, sitting there on the boulder with the sun shining down and the river babbling around me, was one I could be in and enjoy for what it is.
