For most of my life, I was a man without a drink. A big part of that, of course, was that my country doesn't permit drinking until you're 21 and I felt somehow obliged to follow this insane rule. But beyond that, it was because I hadn't found that perfect cocktail until I was old enough to know better.

Why am I writing this now on my _tech blog_? For a couple reasons: I can write about whatever the hell I please on my blog. And secondly, I've been in a bit of a rut so I thought it might help to change it up and write about something I've been enjoying lately.

Now back to the story. I didn't drink in college because most of the examples I saw were not appealing. I didn't have anyone model responsible drinking to me other than my dad. But he mostly drank beer and I knew for a fact that beer taste like shit because of that one time my dad let me have a taste when I was a kid. Don't worry, I've long since corrected my folly of youth and enjoy beer immensely.

For most college kids, the focus of drinking is to get wasted so the choice in alcohol is dictated by what can a student afford and what will get them shit faced most quickly. Not all, mind you. I'm just relating my experience.

When I first started going to bars and clubs, my drink choices often revolved around what's sweet and what will get me buzzed. I went through that puerile Long Island Iced Tea period. I had my brief infatuation with Adios Motherfuckers. But put in a classy social situation, I always hesitated when it came to ordering a drink. I hadn't found my drink. I went through a Mojito period (which I still enjoy on a hot summer day), the gin and tonic period (which I mostly just tolerated), and so on.

I wanted to be like the men in the movies and television who knew exactly what they wanted. Bond, James Bond, knew he wanted a Martini, shaken, not stirred (which I hear is actually the opposite of how a martini should actually be prepared but I digress). Don Draper can be counted on to order an Old Fashioned.

Which coincidentally became my first drink that was "my drink". To celebrate shipping GitHub for Windows 1.0, GitHub threw a party at the Ferry House in San Francisco. It was a classy affair with several bar stations. As per the usual, I was asking around for drink recommendations when I got in line and decided I would try a Gimlet. I get to the front of the line and attempt to order the Gimlet, but the bartender swept his hand across the ingredients arrayed in front of him and told me that this was an Old Fashioned station. He only made Old Fashioneds.

Perfect! It was the direct opposite of the Paradox of Choice. Given one choice, I knew what to do. So I ordered an Old Fashioned and we instantly hit it off. Where have you been all my life. So began my love affair with the Old Fashioned.

There was only one problem, I couldn't for the life of me make a decent one at home. Part of the problem is there's too much work involved and I'm a lazy asshole. Around that time I was introduced to the Classic Manhattan. There was a particularly good one at the iPic theater (of all places) made with a bourbon they kept in a small cask (they no longer have this specific bourbon, but their Manhattan's are still good).

This became my new drink. It's Old Fashioned's simpler more refined minimalist cousin. There were evenings I'd walk a mile to the local Tutta Bella to order one because I'd get the craving. Until my wife smacked me with an epiphany. Go to the Total Wine and More store, pick up the ingredients, and learn to make one.

Of course! A classic Manhattan is much easier to make than a proper Old Fashioned. There's only three ingredients, Rye Whiskey (for a classic, though I prefer Bourbon), Sweet Vermouth, and Angostura Bitters. Should you choose, you can also garnish it with a maraschino cherry, which I always do.

Here's how I prepare my Manhattan. I'm interested in some simple easy variations though, if you have them. Remember though, I'm lazy.

### Tools

* Measuring tool
* Stirring spoon (not shake)
* Cocktail Shaker/Mixer

### Ingredients

* Maker's Mark (It's a very good smooth tasty Bourbon. I'm on the lookout for recommendations though.)
* Sweet Vermouth (I've not tried multiple brands yet so I just went with the one they had.)
* Angostura Bitters
* Maraschino Cherry

An important note. If you've ever gone to a classy bar, you'll notice that the cherry they use is darker and more flavorful than the bright red supermarket Maraschino cherry. These cherries are often Bourbon infused and cost a lot more than the bright red variety. I think they're absolutely worth it.

If you're single and have ample freezer room, freeze your glass. What I do is fill it up with crushed ice while I'm making the drink to keep the glass cold. I'll remove the ice before I pour in the drink.

### Directions

1. Freeze or fill up your glass with crushed ice. It's nice to have a cold glass.
2. Fill up your cocktail shaker/mixer with ice. I use crushed ice.
3. Pour 2 ounces of Rye Whiskey/Bourbon into the shaker.
4. Pour 1/2 ounce of Sweet Vermouth into the shaker.
5. Add 3 dashes of the Angostura Bitters to the shaker.
6. Stir well to get it cold. Most sites (and I) recommend not shaking it and making it frothy. It's really up to you. If you want to go all Tom Cruise on that, by all means.
7. Empty the ice from the glass (important!).
8. Put the shaker cap on and pour the cocktail into the glass.
9. Add the Maraschino cherry and maybe a bit of the cherry juice if you like.
10. Savor your perfect classic Manhattan, you classy person, you.

Learning to make this drink saved me a lot of money considering a Manhattan with good Bourbon can go for over ten to fifteen bucks at a bar. My next goal is to learn a few variations and maybe one alternative cocktail for when I get tired of drinking the same thing all the time.

What's your go to drink and why?
