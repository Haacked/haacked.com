![Christmas Lights](https://haacked.com/images/ChrismastLights.jpg) These
days I tend to find the holidays more a burden than something to look
forward to. However with my family visiting us this year, I am quite
excited. Maybe I’ll put up some lights like [this
display](http://www.mypartypost.com/watchvideo/1033/Best_Christmas_Lights_Display_Ever).
The screenshot doesn’t do the video justice. It has to be seen.
