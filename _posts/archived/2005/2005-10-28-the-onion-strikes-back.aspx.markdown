In response to the White House asking [The
Onion](http://www.theonion.com/) to [stop using the presidential
seal](http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/10/26/odd.onion.reut/index.html)
on the website, the onion added a [link to this to its front
page](http://www.theonion.com/content/node/42136).

Note to self. Do NOT piss off The Onion.
