When building an installer for a Windows Service in VS.NET 2003,
conspicuously missing is the ability to specify a description for the
service that is displayed in the Services applet.

I've written a base installer class that inherits from
System.Configuration.Install.Installer for this purpose, but I'll just
present to you the source listings for the methods to add and remove a
service description.

Check [it out here](/articles/1549.aspx). I hope you find it useful.
