Steve Harman points out another [bug in the upgrade
process](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2006/10/29/Subtext_1.9.2__Upgrade_Bug.aspx). 
I feel really terrible that this one slipped through, though as far as I
can tell so far, it may be mostly cosmetic in its effect.  It apparently
converts some comments to trackbacks.  While this is not desirable
behavior, since we show both comments and trackbacks in the comment
section, it might not have a huge negative effect.

Unfortunately, I am in San Jose right now, so I can’t update the release
with a fix yet. Hopefully Steve can handle it.
