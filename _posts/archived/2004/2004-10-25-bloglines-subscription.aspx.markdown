Weird. I did a google search for an entry in my blog and one of the
results was a bloglines account that had my blog subscribed. I was
basically seeing all the blogs that some bloglines user was subscribed
to. Is that a feature of bloglines to expose your subscriptions like
that? Or is that a privacy flaw?

UPDATE: Nevermind. I'm just being paranoid. Bloglines supports public
profiles.
