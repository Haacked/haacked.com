'Tis the time of year to find a new job for many. Among many pieces of
advice I could give you, I leave you with this one. When you go to an
interview, please please please bring several copies of your resume. For
your own sake!

Out of every technical interview I've conducted this year, not one
person brought a copy of their resume.
