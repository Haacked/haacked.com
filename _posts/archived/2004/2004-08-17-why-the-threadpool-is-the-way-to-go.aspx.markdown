In a [previous post](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/10/895.aspx), I
talked about Anynchronous sockets and its reliance on the ThreadPool and
made an uninformed remark about potentially needing to up the ThreadPool
count. [Ian](http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/) posted a
[comment](https://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/10/895.aspx#924)describing
why the ThreadPool is very often the way to go for socket programming,
correcting my assumption. But as always, measure measure measure to be
sure. Go read it. Thanks!
