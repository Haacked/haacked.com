What is the proper way to add three hours to a `DateTime` for the PST timezone? Is it this?

```csharp
var d = DateTime.Parse("Oct 26, 2003 12:00:00 AM");
var later = d.AddHours(3.0);
Console.WriteLine(later); // displays 10/26/2003 03:00:00 AM which is NOT correct!
```

A valiant attempt, but wrong. Instead try this:

```csharp
var d = DateTime.Parse("Oct 26, 2003 12:00:00 AM");
var later = d.ToUniversalTime().AddHours(3.0).ToLocalTime();
Console.WriteLine(later); // displays 10/26/2003 02:00:00 AM which is correct!
```

Or better yet, use `DateTimeOffset`.

```csharp
const string dateFormat = "MMM dd yyyy h:mm tt zzz";
var d = DateTimeOffset.ParseExact("Oct 26 2003 12:00 AM -07:00", dateFormat, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
var later = d.AddHours(3.0);
Console.WriteLine(later);
```

Why all the [rigamarole](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&q=rigamarole "Definition of Rigamarole")
of converting to universal time and back to local time? A little thing we like to call Daylight savings time. Without the conversion, adding three hours would have set the time to 3:00 AM which would be wrong.

Realizing this probably would have saved me from many hours of intense debugging sessions. I remember one particular case with a system of scripts and tools I set up to analyze the very large log files for a big client. It hummed along nicely until one fine spring day when it failed miserably. After an entire day of tracking down the source of the problem, I finally nailed it down to a scriptâ€™s mishandling of Daylight Savings.

To find out more about proper `DateTime` handling, read the following article concerning best practices with [manipulating date times](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/datetimecode.asp "Best practices with DateTime").
