So I keep blabbing and blabbing about my new RSS Feed. I keep imploring
you to get an RSS aggregator and subscribe to my feed. What the hell am
I talking about?!

Well to clear things up, I wrote [an
article](https://haacked.com/articles/182.aspx)
about how to get started with [RssBandit](http://www.rssbandit.org), a
very nice RSS Aggregator created by [Dare
Obasanjo](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/SyndicationService.asmx/GetRss)
et all. Please take the time to read it and follow its instructions.
Especially you Dad. If I've done well, the article will clear thing up
and you will have a subscription to my blog.

You can also [download it as a word
doc](https://haacked.com/GettingStartedWithRssBandit.zip)
