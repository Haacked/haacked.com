Peli has a [post
about](http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/archive/2004/08/31/869.aspx) a new
[Reflector](http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/) Add-In he will release
soon. It generates a statement graph from the body of a method. It's a
nice way to produce a flowchart and visualize the "flow" of execution
within a method. See an example below:
