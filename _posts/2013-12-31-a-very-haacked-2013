It's the end of the year and I hope it was a good one for you. It's been a great one for me and my family. As the kids get older, they become a lot more fun to be around.

Contribution graphs are not a great way to determine the impact you've had in a year. They don't capture a lot of important work that you do that can't be be captured by GitHub.

But at the same time, the gaps in a contribution graph tell as much a story as the areas that are filled in. So I find them fun to look at from a historical perspective. For example, you can see when I go on vacation based on my graphs.

Here's two of my contribution graphs. The first one is what I see as it shows contributions to both public and private repositories.

The second one shows what the public sees. This is perhaps a decent, though not perfect, representation of the work I've done with open source.

## What I wrote, that people seemed to like

My three most popular posts written in 2013 according to Google Analytics are:

1. [Death to the if statement](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/11/08/death-to-the-if-statement.aspx) - more robust code with less control structures with 25,987 page views.
2. [Argue well by losing](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/10/21/argue-well-by-losing.aspx/) - You only learn something when you lose an argument with 21,264 views.
3. [Test Better](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/03/04/test-better.aspx/) - How developers should become better testers with 15,618 views

By the way, does anyone know how to easily do a report in Google Analytics for content _created_ in a year?

## What I've Shipped

This past year, I've had the pleasure to be involved in shipping the following:

1. [GitHub Enterprise support in GitHub for Windows](https://github.com/blog/1628-enterprise-support-in-github-for-windows)
2. [Octokit.net](https://github.com/blog/1676-introducing-octokit-net)
3. [ChooseALicense.com](https://github.com/blog/1530-choosing-an-open-source-license)
4. [RestSharp](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/09/18/restsharp-104-2-0-released.aspx/) - a few releases actually.
5. According to FitBit, I had `4,547,191` steps this year (approximately `2,085` miles). This is up from `3,115,606` steps (`1,513.57` miles) in 2012.

## You People

Yeah, let's talk about you. You people are my favorite. Well, most of you.

* __Visitors__ `1,456,309` unique visitors made `2,083,957` visits. Those numbers are down `25.17%` and `22.57%` respectively from the previous year.

* __RSS Subscribers__ According to FeedBurner, there are still `84,377` subscribers to my RSS feed which is surprising given the demise of Google Reader. I guess everybody found replacements. Or the stats are jacked.
